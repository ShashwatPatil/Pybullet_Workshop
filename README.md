# Pybullet_Workshop

### Pybullet workshop for batch of 2023.

For basic information about pybullet and how to use functions present in it, please visit [PyBullet Starter Guide](https://github.com/ShashwatPatil/Pybullet_Workshop/blob/4d4bdb851fcbc4e88ac977fa8036f52400882815/pybullet_quickstartguide.pdf) [This will be the most important core source of your information through out the workshop]

Welcome to Week 2 of WinterCamp this week facilitate learning about different components of image processing and its application in building robots capable of autonomous movement. This repo holds the task of pybullet workshop. The Arenas are in the form of an OpenAI gym and runs on python libraries like Pybullet and OpenCV.

###### GOOD LUCK

### You are now ready for the Tasks

## Link to the workshop slides
- Soon to be added

## Code used in the Workshop 
The code can be found in the example's folder. Try to run and understand the example code scripts and Experiment with it.

# Task:
Go to the Task_scripts folder to find the task files.
## Task 1 
Your task is to use env.move() and p.getKeyboardEvents() to control the husky using the arrow keys
of you keyboard and make the husky stop when the spacebar is pressed just like games :D
## Task 2
Your Task is to grab the ball that is in front of the husky and then find the humanoid and shoot the ball.
Your code should be using opencv to autonomously grab the ball and shoot.
## Task 3 (BONUS TASK)
Your task is to make husky follow the red line autonomously using opencv and PID control.
